# Automata

Prototyping library for Finite Automaton in Python. Will be implemented in an other language in the future.

## Current features

Support for :

- Determinitic Finite Automaton (DFA)
- Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)
- Determinization of a NFA
- Execution of an (D/N)FA on a word of its alphabet

## Future things to implement

- Transitions of `State` as `dict`
- Drawing with Graphviz
- Build an FA from regular expressions
- Improve management of new states while determinizing an NFA
